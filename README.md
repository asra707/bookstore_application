# Guidelines for Java Application Setup and Execution 


This README provides instructions on setting up and running a Java application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database using JDBC.


## Notes


- Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running before executing the Java application.
- Securely handle sensitive data, such as database credentials.
- Exercise caution when performing database operations like insertion, updating, deletion, etc. since they can impact the database.


## Prerequisites


1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure Java JDK is installed on your system.


2. **PostgreSQL Database:** Install PostgreSQL and create the database. Note down the database username and password for configuration.


## Steps


1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download the repository containing the Java code to your local machine.


2. **Update Database Connection Details:**
   - Open the `JDBC.java` file in a text editor or an IDE.
   - Modify the `url`, `username`, and `password` variables in the `main` method to match your PostgreSQL database connection details.


## Running the Application


1. **Execute the Application:**
   - Run the compiled Java application using the commands


2. **Interacting with the Application:**
   - Inside the `main` method of `JDBC.java`, there are different operations (commented lines) like `insertAuthor`, `insertBook`, `updateBook`, `transaction`, etc. Uncomment any of these operations to perform specific tasks.
